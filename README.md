### Howdy! 👋

I'm Perry, Based out of Los Angeles and currently looking for work in the full-stack world. I enjoy both client and server-side development and am happy working with either, I'm always looking to up my UX/UI design skills and database design knowledge/optimization! I recently wrapped up a remote internship at The Rithm School where I improved and expanded the student information portal, a large Django App built by a seasoned industry pro ( He set the bar high ). Hit me up if you want to collab or talk sports! [You can check out my website here...](https://www.perryvon.dev/)
